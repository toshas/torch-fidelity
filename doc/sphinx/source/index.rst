torch-fidelity: High-fidelity performance metrics for generative models in PyTorch
==================================================================================

**torch-fidelity** provides **precise**, **efficient**, and **extensible** implementations of the popular metrics for
generative model evaluation, including:

* Inception Score (ISC_)
* Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID_)
* Kernel Inception Distance (KID_)
* Perceptual Path Length (PPL_)
* Precision, Recall (PRC_)

.. _ISC: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.03498.pdf
.. _FID: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.08500.pdf
.. _KID: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.01401.pdf
.. _PPL: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.04948.pdf
.. _PRC: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.06991.pdf

**Precision**: Unlike many other reimplementations, the values produced by torch-fidelity match reference
implementations up to machine precision. This allows using torch-fidelity for reporting metrics in papers instead of
scattered and slow reference implementations.

**Efficiency**: Feature sharing between different metrics saves recomputation time, and an additional caching
level avoids recomputing features and statistics whenever possible. High efficiency allows using torch-fidelity in the
training loop, for example at the end of every epoch.

**Extensibility**: Going beyond 2D image generation is easy due to high modularity and abstraction of the metrics from
input data, models, and feature extractors. For example, one can swap out InceptionV3 feature extractor for a one
accepting 3D scan volumes, such as used in MRI.

**TLDR; fast and reliable GAN evaluation in PyTorch**
